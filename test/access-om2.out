 The shallowest wet ocean model grid cell has depth (meters)     10.43281
 and this occurs at (i,j,k) = (846, 73,  7)
 which has (long,lat,depth) =  ( -195.4500,  -78.0674,    10.43281)

 Beware that shallow regions (e.g., those shallower than 50m) may be subject
 to numerical problems if strong surface forcing is not mixed vertically.
 Such problems may occur especially in shallow regions with kmt==2.
 Current speeds and/or tracer deviations may become large due to the deposition
 of wind and/or buoyancy over just a small upper ocean region. Such problems
 can be resolved by adding sufficient vertical mixing in these regions.
 Such happens in Nature due to tides and breaking surface waves.

NOTE from PE     0: Using barotropic predictor-corrector for integrating barotropic dynamics.

 Predictor-Corrector time filter on barotropic dynamics has value=   0.20

 Updating eta_t or pbot_t using a big time step as in MOM4.0. Not recommended for OBC applications.

 Initialise sum of barotropic sea level with eta_t or pbot_t. This is the default.

 ==>Using smooth_eta_t_laplacian to smooth eta_t.

  ==> Note: Computing EOS assuming prognostic temp = potential temperature.

  ==> Note: Computing EOS assuming prognostic salinity = practical salinity.

  ==> Note: Computing diagnostic neutral_rho as potential density referenced to pressure potrho_press.

  ==> Note: Enforcing drhodz_diag < 0, so to use stable stratification for certain diagnostic purposes.

  ==> Note: Diagnostic factors are NOT computed. So if enable watermass diagnostics, they will be corrupted.

          Since rho0 .ne. rho_average, consider changing rho0 in
